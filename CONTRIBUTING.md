# Contributing

Hey, thanks for considering contributing to this list. We really appreciate it.

Please follow the following guidelines when submitting a PR -

* Always create an issue for a new alias/snippet.
* Read the introduction in README and make sure your addition(s) are valid for this awesome list.
* Description about links should give an account of the outstanding features and major short-coming of the item, if any.
* Description should end with a full-stop.
* New categories can be created if and when needed.

Apart from that,

* Try to avoid adding similar snippets in **Miscellaneous** section. At max 2 similar kinds of apps are acceptable.
* If there are lots of similar snippets/aliases for something you want to add and the thing you are adding has no advantage over them, don't add it.
* Check your spelling and grammar twice before submitting a PR.
